NAME
    Mojo::Reactor::Prima - Prima event loop backend for Mojo::Reactor

DESCRIPTION
    Mojo::Reactor::Prima is an event reactor for Mojo::IOLoop that uses
    Prima. The usage is exactly the same as other Mojo::Reactor
    implementations such as Mojo::Reactor::Poll. Mojo::Reactor::Prima will
    be used as the default backend for Mojo::IOLoop if it is loaded before
    Mojo::IOLoop or any module using the loop. However, when invoking a
    Mojolicious application through morbo or hypnotoad, the reactor must be
    set as the default by setting the "MOJO_REACTOR" environment variable to
    "Mojo::Reactor::Prima".
